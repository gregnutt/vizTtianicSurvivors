####Feedback:

######"I don't find the colors for male and female to be complementary."
After some back and forth, we settled on colors that were more pleasing to the eye: Indigo (#3F51b5) for males and Accent Pink (#FF4081) for females.

######"It is unclear if the chart is showing number of survivors or percent of survivors.  Change the title or axis labels to reflect something like 'Number of Survivors/Number of Casualties"

######"Showing % of survivors in each age range would also be interesting."

######"It might also be cool to see the effects across age ranges of other factors, such as passenger class or embarcation location."
