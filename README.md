####Feedback:

######"I don't find the colors for male and female to be complementary."
After some back and forth, we settled on colors that were more pleasing to the eye: #b3cde3 for males and Accent Pink (#fbb4ae) for females.

######"It is unclear if the chart is showing number of survivors or percent of survivors.  Change the title or axis labels to reflect something like 'Number of Survivors/Number of Casualties"
Updated Chart title and y-axis label to be more clear.

######"It might also be cool to see the effects across age ranges of other factors, such as passenger class or embarcation location."
Added functionality to switch color sorting to allow audience to compare survival/casualty distributions for Sex, Passenger Class, and Embarkation location.
